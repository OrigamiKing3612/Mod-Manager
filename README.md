# I am kinda done with modding so this mod is archived. I may get back to it one day.

# Mod-Manager
A not-so-pretty (for now) Mod-Manager for Minecraft. 

This mod will:
1. Have a browsing page for mods, resource packs, shaders, and data packs
2. Have a mod and possibly resource and data pack updater
